## 📖 Project Overview
This application is designed to simplify group financial tracking while providing a world-class user experience. Inspired by **Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines**, the UI utilizes semi-transparent layers and background blur effects (`backdrop-filter`) to create a modern, "glossy" aesthetic.

On the backend, a robust Node.js engine calculates complex peer-to-peer debts and manages data persistence via a JSON-based file system.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Premium iOS UI:** Frosted-glass effects and pill-shaped interactive elements.
- **Intelligent Split Engine:** Automatically determines "who owes whom" based on input.
- **Dynamic Member Management:** Add or remove participants in real-time.
- **Transaction History:** A clean, tabular view of all past expenses with a one-click "Clear History" feature.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (Functional Components, Hooks, CSS Grid/Flexbox)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** Local JSON File System (for lightweight, high-speed data handling)
